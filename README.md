# p5-sketch-video-tutorial
This is me learning how to upload my p5.js skectch to Github for hosting with github pages

In the video 15:36 you see the teacher has set up software that authenticate him to use the terminal for this repo. I cannot use the terminal the same way but I have followed the tutorial video. I created this personal repo so I can submit it as done homework into CYF Google classroom.
